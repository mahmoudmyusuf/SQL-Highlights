# Key Takeaways and Notes

## ðŸ“Œ Data Stored in SQL Databases  
1. Stored in **tables**, similar to Excel spreadsheets, with **rows** and **columns**.  
2. Each **row** holds data on a **transaction**.  
3. Each **column** represents a **specific aspect** of the data.  
4. All data in the same **column** must have the same **data type**.

## ðŸ“Œ SQL Databases  
There are many different types of **SQL databases**, each designed for different purposes. They may have differences in **syntax** and **available functions**.

### ðŸ”¹ Some of the most popular SQL databases:  
1. **MySQL**  
2. **Microsoft Access**  
3. **Oracle**  
4. **Microsoft SQL Server**  
5. **PostgreSQL**  

ðŸš€ In these **highlights**, we will use **Microsoft SQL Server**.

## ðŸ“Œ SQL Statement  
A **SQL statement** is a correctly written **SQL code** that tells the database what action to perform on the data.

### ðŸ”¹ Common SQL Statements:  
- `CREATE TABLE` â†’ Creates a **new table** in a database.  
- `DROP TABLE` â†’ Removes a **table** from a database.  
- `SELECT` â†’ Reads and displays **data** from a table (**query**).  

ðŸ’¡ The `SELECT` statement is the most commonly used by **data analysts**.

## ðŸ“Œ Good to Know  
1. âœ… **SQL queries are case-insensitive**, meaning they will run successfully whether commands are written in **upper** or **lower** case.  
2. âœ… It is a **best practice** to capitalize all **SQL commands** (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`) and keep everything else in **lowercase**.  
3. âœ… **SQL is case-sensitive** when it comes to **text data** stored in SQL tables.  
4. âœ… Use **underscores** (`_`) and **avoid spaces** in column names.  
   - If a column or table name contains spaces, **use double quotes (`""`)** to refer to it.  
5. âœ… **SQL queries ignore spaces**, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as needed.  
6. âœ… **Best practice**: End each statement with a **semicolon (`;`)**.  
   - Some SQL environments **require** a semicolon at the end of your query to execute it.  
7. âœ… Save SQL query files with a `.sql` extension in **Atom** or **Sublime** to enable **SQL syntax highlighting**.
